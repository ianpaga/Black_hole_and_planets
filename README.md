Black Hole and Planets Simulation - Newtonian & General Relativistic Corrections
====

Description: Simulate multi-body gravitational dynamics comparing Newtonian and General Relativity effects.

This script simulates the motion of multiple bodies orbiting around a central massive black hole.
It compares Newtonian dynamics with General Relativity corrections highlighting differences.
